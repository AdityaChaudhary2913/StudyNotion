# StudyNotion Project Summary

## Overview

StudyNotion is a full-stack EdTech platform designed to facilitate online learning and teaching. It provides a robust environment for instructors to create and manage courses, and for students to explore, purchase, and learn from a wide variety of educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and incorporates modern best practices for scalability, security, and user experience.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure signup, login, OTP verification, password reset, and role-based access (Student, Instructor, Admin).
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, edit, and publish courses with sections, sub-sections, videos, and resources.
- **Catalog & Discovery**: Students can browse courses by category, view details, and read reviews.
- **Enrollment & Payment**: Secure payment integration with Razorpay and Stripe. Students can purchase courses and track their progress.
- **Progress Tracking**: Students' course progress is tracked, and instructors can view analytics.
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Enrolled students can rate and review courses.
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface with dynamic navigation and dashboards.
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails for verification, enrollment, password changes, and payment confirmations.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, RESTful API, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, JWT authentication, role-based middleware, payment and email integrations.
- **Frontend**: React, Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router v6 for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, Axios for API calls, Stripe for client-side payments.

## Folder Structure

```
server/   # Backend code (API, models, controllers, config)
src/      # Frontend code (React components, pages, state, services)
public/   # Static assets
```

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Cloudinary, Razorpay, Stripe, Nodemailer
- **Frontend**: React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Chart.js, Stripe

## Security & Best Practices

- Passwords are hashed (bcrypt)
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure media uploads and payment verification
- Environment variables for all secrets and keys

## Extensibility

- Modular codebase for easy feature addition
- Clear separation of concerns (API, business logic, UI, state)
- Scalable for new roles, analytics, notifications, and integrations

## Documentation

- Detailed technical and conceptual documentation is available for both server and client in:
  - `./server_overview.md`
  - `./client_overview.md`
